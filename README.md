# AE4ASM521 Assignment 1: Two Scale Topology Optimization Assignment
This repository contains the two-scale topology optimization problem of an outdoor bench. Different porosities are compared and evaluated
on their compliance performance, both without damage and with damage in two different regions to obtain the stiffest design for the bench.
